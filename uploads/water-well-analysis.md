    # Water Well Analysis Results

    ## Water Availability Probability
    Based on the provided geological data, the estimated probability of finding water is approximately **77%**.

    ## Estimated Water Quality
    The water quality is likely to be influenced by the sandy soil composition. Further testing would be required for a definitive assessment.

    ## Recommended Drilling Depth
    For the given conditions, a recommended drilling depth would be between 390 and 420 meters.

    ## Potential Challenges
    - Soil composition may affect drilling equipment selection
    - Local regulations should be consulted before drilling
    - Seasonal variations in water table should be considered

    ## Sustainability Assessment
    The long-term sustainability of a well in this location would depend on local rainfall patterns and aquifer recharge rates.
